# Deployment Guide - SaaS Features

## üöÄ Deployment Status

‚úÖ **Code Status**: All changes merged to `main` branch
‚úÖ **GitHub**: All code pushed to https://github.com/criadacasa/VibeCast
‚úÖ **Branch**: `main` is up to date with all SaaS features

## üìã Pre-Deployment Checklist

### 1. Environment Setup

Before deploying, ensure you have these environment variables configured:

#### Required Environment Variables

```bash
# Convex
CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT=<your-convex-deployment>
VITE_CONVEX_URL=<your-convex-url>

# Stripe (for payments)
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...  # Use sk_test_... for testing
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_...

# WorkOS (existing auth)
VITE_WORKOS_CLIENT_ID=<your-workos-client-id>
VITE_WORKOS_REDIRECT_URI=<your-redirect-uri>
VITE_WORKOS_API_HOSTNAME=<your-api-hostname>

# Optional: Additional API keys
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=<your-key>
GOOGLE_API_KEY=<your-key>
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-key>
XAI_API_KEY=<your-key>
```

### 2. Database Migration

The new schema requires running migrations:

```bash
# The schema changes are additive and backward compatible
# No migration script needed - Convex handles schema updates automatically
# Just deploy the new schema.ts file
```

### 3. Seed Subscription Plans

**IMPORTANT**: Run this once after deployment:

```bash
# Connect to your production Convex deployment
npx convex dev --once --prod

# Seed the subscription plans
npx convex run --prod seedPlans:seedSubscriptionPlans

# Verify plans were created
npx convex run --prod billing:getSubscriptionPlans
```

### 4. Configure Stripe

#### Create Products in Stripe Dashboard

1. Go to https://dashboard.stripe.com/products
2. Create 4 products:
   - **Free Tier** (for reference, $0)
   - **Starter Plan** - $29/month, $290/year
   - **Pro Plan** - $99/month, $990/year
   - **Enterprise Plan** - $499/month, $4,990/year

3. Copy the Price IDs and Product IDs

#### Update Plans with Stripe IDs

```bash
# Update each plan with its Stripe IDs
npx convex run --prod seedPlans:updateStripePriceIds \
  --planName "starter" \
  --stripePriceIdMonthly "price_xxx" \
  --stripePriceIdYearly "price_yyy" \
  --stripeProductId "prod_zzz"

# Repeat for pro and enterprise plans
```

#### Set Up Stripe Webhook

1. Go to https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks
2. Add endpoint: `https://your-domain.com/api/webhooks/stripe`
3. Select these events:
   - `customer.subscription.created`
   - `customer.subscription.updated`
   - `customer.subscription.deleted`
   - `invoice.paid`
   - `invoice.payment_failed`
4. Copy the webhook signing secret
5. Add to environment variables as `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`

## üèóÔ∏è Deployment Steps

### Option A: Vercel Deployment (Recommended)

This project uses Vercel for hosting. Follow these steps:

#### 1. Initial Vercel Setup

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI (if not installed)
npm install -g vercel

# Login to Vercel
vercel login

# Link to Vercel project
vercel link --scope convex-dev --project chef -y

# Pull environment variables (if already configured)
vercel env pull
```

#### 2. Set Environment Variables

```bash
# Add required environment variables
vercel env add STRIPE_SECRET_KEY production
vercel env add STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET production
vercel env add NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY production

# Add other required variables as needed
```

#### 3. Deploy to Preview (Staging)

```bash
# Build the project
pnpm run build

# Deploy to preview
vercel

# Test the preview URL thoroughly
# Preview URL will be: https://chef-<unique-id>.vercel.app
```

#### 4. Deploy to Production

```bash
# After testing preview, deploy to production
vercel --prod

# Or push to release branch (per project workflow)
git checkout main
git pull
git push origin main:staging  # Deploy to staging
# Test staging thoroughly
git push origin staging:release  # Deploy to production
```

### Option B: Manual Deployment

If not using Vercel automatic deployment:

```bash
# 1. Build the project
pnpm install
pnpm run build

# 2. Deploy Convex backend
npx convex deploy --prod

# 3. Deploy frontend (platform-specific)
# Follow your hosting provider's deployment instructions
```

## üîç Post-Deployment Verification

### 1. Check Convex Functions

```bash
# List all functions
npx convex dashboard --prod
# Navigate to Functions tab and verify new functions are deployed:
# - billing:*
# - apiIntegrations:*
# - seedPlans:*
```

### 2. Verify Database Tables

In Convex Dashboard ‚Üí Data:
- [ ] subscriptionPlans (should have 4 plans)
- [ ] subscriptions
- [ ] creditBalances
- [ ] creditTransactions
- [ ] usageRecords
- [ ] apiIntegrations
- [ ] apiQueries
- [ ] webhooks
- [ ] payments
- [ ] invoices
- [ ] dailyUsageStats

### 3. Test UI Pages

Visit these URLs on your production domain:
- [ ] `/billing/plans` - Plan selector page loads
- [ ] `/billing` - Billing dashboard (requires auth)
- [ ] `/integrations` - Integrations dashboard (requires auth)

### 4. Test Stripe Webhook

```bash
# Use Stripe CLI to test webhook locally
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:5173/api/webhooks/stripe

# Trigger test events
stripe trigger customer.subscription.created
stripe trigger invoice.paid
```

### 5. Test Credit Flow

Create a test subscription and verify:
- [ ] Subscription created
- [ ] Credits allocated
- [ ] Usage can be recorded
- [ ] Credits are deducted
- [ ] Transaction history appears

## üîí Security Checklist

Before going live:
- [ ] All API keys are in environment variables (not hardcoded)
- [ ] Stripe webhook secret is configured
- [ ] HTTPS is enabled on all endpoints
- [ ] Rate limiting is configured (per plan)
- [ ] API key masking is working
- [ ] Credential encryption is enabled
- [ ] Authentication is required for all sensitive routes

## üìä Monitoring Setup

### 1. Set Up Alerts

Configure alerts for:
- Low credit warnings (< 100 credits)
- Payment failures
- API integration errors
- High usage spikes
- Webhook failures

### 2. Analytics

Track these metrics:
- Daily active users
- Credit consumption rate
- Subscription conversions
- API integration usage
- Payment success rate

### 3. Error Tracking

Enable error tracking for:
- Failed payment attempts
- Integration connection errors
- Credit deduction failures
- Webhook processing errors

## üîÑ Rollback Plan

If issues occur after deployment:

### Immediate Rollback (Vercel)

```bash
# Rollback to previous deployment
vercel rollback <deployment-url>
```

### Database Rollback

The new schema is additive, so no rollback needed. If data issues:

```bash
# Connect to production
npx convex dev --once --prod

# Manually clean up test data if needed
# Use Convex dashboard to delete specific records
```

## üìà Gradual Rollout Strategy

### Phase 1: Beta Testing (Week 1)
1. Enable for internal team only
2. Test all critical flows
3. Monitor for errors
4. Fix any issues found

### Phase 2: Limited Release (Week 2)
1. Enable for 10% of users
2. Monitor usage patterns
3. Gather feedback
4. Optimize based on data

### Phase 3: Full Release (Week 3+)
1. Enable for all users
2. Continue monitoring
3. Iterate on feedback
4. Scale infrastructure as needed

## üéØ Success Metrics

Track these KPIs post-deployment:
- [ ] Subscription conversion rate > 5%
- [ ] Payment success rate > 98%
- [ ] API integration creation rate
- [ ] Average credits used per user
- [ ] User retention rate
- [ ] Support ticket volume

## üìû Support Preparation
